These are a couple of small applications that chart amplitude and frequency spectrums using Fourier Fast Transforms. 

The .py files need to be run with python:

Run "python playwav.py somewavfile.wav" to get raw data of the freqency spectrum and amplitude

In the sketch folder is a java app using Processing, compiled version for Mac OSX which can take in any wav file and will give a live visualization of the frequency spectrum over the amplitude.

Any rb file will be run with ruby
